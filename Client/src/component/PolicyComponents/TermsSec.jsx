            In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is
            determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision
            will remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
            applicable law. The unenforceable portion shall be severed from
            these Terms of Service, and such determination shall not affect the
            validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

            The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred before the
            termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for
            all purposes. These Terms of Service are effective until terminated
            by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any
            time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services or
            by discontinuing your use of our site. If we, in our sole judgment,
            believe that you have failed to comply with any term or provision of
            these Terms of Service or suspect such failure, we may terminate
            this agreement at any time without notice. You will remain liable
            for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination. We
            may also deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof)
            accordingly.

            Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of
            Service does not waive that right or provision. These Terms of
            Service, along with any policies or operational guidelines posted on
            this site or related to The Service, constitute the entire agreement
            and understanding between you and us. They govern your use of the
            Service and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements,
            communications, and proposals, whether oral or written, between you
            and us, including any earlier versions of these Terms of Service.
            Any ambiguities in interpreting these Terms of Service will not be
            construed against the party responsible for drafting them.
