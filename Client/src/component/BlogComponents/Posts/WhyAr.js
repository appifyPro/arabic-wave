            <p>Arabic is one of the top five most spoken languages, and learning it is a worthwhile endeavor. About 400 million people speak Arabic. It is also the official language of more than 25 countries, and it has had an impact worldwide. Regarding the importance of learning Arabic in Islam and what it means for a Muslim's life, Arabic is at the center of the Islamic faith. It is seen as the actual language of Islam because it is written in the Holy Quran, the Sunnah of the prophet, and the Islamic heritage. The lines above show why it should be a top priority for every Muslim in the world to learn Arabic and treat it with the respect and appreciation it deserves since it is an integral part of our religion. Here are some more reasons why you should learn to read and speak Arabic:</p>
            <h1>The Qur'an's Relationship with the Arabic Language</h1>
            <p>As all of the Holy Scriptures are written in Arabic, one of the hardest things for non-Arab Muslims to do is to learn how to read the Quran correctly with Tajweed and to understand the holy book of Allah. Being able to read and remember the Quran in its original language can bring us closer to it and help us build a deeper relationship with Allah SWT. To understand the Quran, it is essential to learn Arabic.</p>
            <h1>Learning More About Muslim Communities</h1>

            </div>
            <p>People think that languages are the key to understanding the traditions and cultures of other countries because they are the way people express themselves. Even if you only know how to talk about the most basic things, being able to speak Arabic gives you the chance to talk to Arab people who live in different Muslim communities. Also, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, a great companion, once said to the Islamic Ummah, "Learn Arabic because it is part of your religion."</p>
            <h1>The Arabic Literature Is Wonderful</h1>
            <p>Arabic literature is brilliant in a way that no other literature is, and it has a special place among the literature of all other languages. Arabic is a rich language that can say a lot with few words. Arabic poetry is also excellent and is still alive today.</p>
            <h1>Achieving Khushu in Salah</h1>
            <p>Prayers are the keys to success both in this world and the next. Lucky for you, there are some steps you can take to increase Khushu and make sure your heart is present when you pray, Salah. One of the best pieces of advice is to learn Arabic to understand the Surahs and Adhkar that are being recited during Salah. This makes it easier to focus on what is being said. Also, your prayers will feel completely different and won't be empty of thought anymore.</p>
            <h1>Getting To Know Islamic Sciences</h1>
            <div className="img center">

            </div>
            <p>Many Islamic sciences come directly from Arab linguistic studies since many of the issues discussed here are about language. To understand these issues, you need to know a lot about Arabic linguistics and its origins. These sciences include al-Tafseer (the interpretation of the Quran), "Uloom al-Quran" (the sciences of the Quran), "Ilm al-Hadeeth," "al-Fiqh" (Islamic law), and "al-'Aqeedah" (Islamic Theology).</p>
            <h1>Develop sincerity in worshipping God.</h1>
            <p>Knowing Arabic makes our devotion to Allah (SWT) and praise of Him much more meaningful. This is especially true when doing the Salat, reciting and listening to the Quran, listening to khutbahs, making Duaa, and other religious activities. But, if we know Arabic, we don't need a mediator or translator between Allah Almighty and us. The reason we are here is to worship Allah and do what he says. When we learn Arabic, we can get a deeper understanding of the Quran. One good thing about learning Arabic is that it makes you more sincere in your worship of Allah Almighty.</p>
            <p>When we understand Arabic, our loyalty to Allah (SWT) and our sense of honor become much more critical. This is because Arabic has a positive Islamic effect on its speakers. If you want to learn more about Islamic culture, you can learn Arabic.</p>
            <h1>Job, Business, and Trade</h1>
            <p>A big part of the world economy is the Arab world. The Arab world is made up of about 22 countries, so you can probably guess how rich this whole area is. Many companies put their money into the Arab world. Since Arab kingdoms (in general) depend on foreigners a lot for their economies to grow, there are many ways to trade, do business, and find work. Even if you don't work in the business world or want to change careers, learning Arabic can be helpful. Arabic skills are also in high demand in many other fields, such as tourism and travel, education, health care, national security, journalism, and many more. In these fields, people who speak both English and Arabic are always in demand.</p>
