            <h1>What is Tajweed Ul Qur’an?</h1>
            <p

              Tajweed, a term stemming from the Arabic root "Jayyid," meaning
              'good,' linguistically signifies proficiency or doing something
              well. When applied to the Qur'an, Tajweed denotes giving every
              letter its due rights and characteristics as we recite the Qur'an,
              while adhering to the specific rules governing these letters under
              various circumstances. These rights are observed by paying heed to
              the fundamental attributes of each letter, while their dues
              involve recognizing characteristics that are occasionally present
              and absent.
            </p>
            <p

            >
              The Qur'an was revealed with Tajweed rules applied to it. In other
              words, when the angel Jibreel (Gabriel), may Allah exalt his
              mention, recited the words of Allah to the Prophet Muhammad
              sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam ( may Allah exalt his mention ) he
              recited them in a certain way and he showed the Prophet
              sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam ( may Allah exalt his mention ) the
              ways in which it was permissible to recite the Qur'an. So it is
              obligatory upon us to observe those rules so that we recite it in
              the way it was revealed.
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              Embracing Tajweed allows us to recite the Qur'an with deep
              devotion, preserving its eloquence, and ensuring that its profound
              meanings are conveyed with the precision and reverence they
              deserve. It is a testament to our commitment to upholding the
              Qur'an's sanctity and delivering its message as intended by the
              Almighty.
            </p>
            <h1>The Virtue and Importance of Tajweed: </h1>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              For Muslims, learning, understanding, and practicing the meanings,
              commands, and limits of the Noble Qur'an is an act of worship and
              obligation. Similarly, reciting the Qur'an's words correctly and
              adhering to the precise pronunciation of its letters is a
              fundamental requirement. The consensus of the Muslim community
              affirms the preservation of the Qur'an's letters, words,
              vowelings, and pauses until today. Likewise, its mode of
              recitation, known as Tajweed, remains preserved and unaltered.
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              Tajweed is a constant science through which the proper
              pronunciation of the Qur'an's letters and their original
              articulation is secured. Without learning the essential matters
              and rules of Tajweed, correct recitation of the Qur'an is
              unattainable. Errors in pronunciation and neglect of Tajweed rules
              can lead to alterations in the divine words' meanings.
              Occasionally, such deviations result in a complete reversal of
              meaning or even the introduction of blasphemous connotations
              (examples are provided below).
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              Reciting the Qur'an in accordance with "Sahih Makharaj" (correct
              articulation) and "Tajweed wa Qirat" (Qur'anic recitation) with an
              "Arabic accent and dialect" is essential for a deep connection
              with the divine text. Tajweed holds foundational importance among
              these sciences since it allows for the proper articulation of
              letters with their essential and non-essential attributes.
              Furthermore, Tajweed enables one to recite the Qur'an according to
              the method of "Qirat Imam Asim," as narrated by Hafs from Shu'bah,
              imparting a profound understanding and appreciation of the
              Qur'anic text.
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              This knowledge stands superior to all other worldly sciences
              because of its association with the Book of Allah, which surpasses
              all other books in the world. The recitation of the Qur'an is
              performed according to the way taught by the Prophet, may Allah
              exalt his mention, and the companions. Prophet Muhammad, may Allah
              exalt his mention, said, "The best among you are those who learn
              the Qur'an and teach it to others" (Sahih al-Bukhari: 5027),
              emphasizing that those who acquire and impart this knowledge are
              the finest individuals among the community.
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              In addition, countless virtues related to learning and reciting
              the Quran have been mentioned in the books of Hadith and Sunnah.
              (These will be mentioned in the following sections.) Among these
              virtues, one is that for every letter recited from the Quran, a
              reward is granted, and the reward for each good deed is multiplied
              tenfold." (Sunan Tirmidhi: 2910)
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              However, it should be remembered that these virtues and rewards
              can only be obtained when the Quran is recited correctly, with
              proper pronunciation and articulation, following the way of the
              Prophet (peace be upon him) and his companions. Incorrect
              recitation, on the other hand, may not only deprive one of these
              rewards but also make them liable to the warnings and punishments.
              (والعیاذ باللہ).

            >
              Scholars have written about Tajweed that reciting the Quranic
              words in accordance with Tajweed rules is obligatory. This means
              it is necessary for every person because reciting the Quran is an
              act of worship, and one of the fundamental conditions for the
              acceptance of worship is that it should be performed in the manner
              established by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), as Allah
              Almighty has said: "There is certainly a good example for you in
              the Messenger of Allah." (Quran 33:21).

            <p

              Listening to the Qur’an being recited correctly is enough to
              soften even the hardest of hearts. Muslims and non-Muslims alike
              find it a deeply moving experience, even if they do not understand
              what is being said. Every Muslim has to recite Qur’an in prayers,
              but many of us do not realise that reciting the Qur’an correctly
              while observing the rules of recitation is not an advanced science
              for expert reciters alone, rather it is an obligation upon each
              and every one of us whenever we recite the Qur’an.
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}

              The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever does an
              act which is not in accordance with our way will have it
              rejected." (Sahih Muslim: 1718, Nasukh Darussalam: 4493). Just as
              we are bound by the way of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in acts
              of worship such as prayer, fasting, and Hajj, it is also necessary
              that we read the Quran just as he did. Just as the understanding
              of the Quran can be based on the Prophet's (peace be upon him)
              clarified meanings, the method of recitation that is attached to
              the Prophet (peace be upon him) is also acceptable.

              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}

              Therefore, just as we are obliged to follow the way of the Prophet
              (peace be upon him) in acts of worship, it is also obligatory for
              us to recite the Noble Quran in the same way that the Prophet
              (peace be upon him) used to recite it. Just as the Prophet (peace
              be upon him) used to read the Quran according to the method of
              Tajweed and Tartil, we are also bound to read it in the same
              manner.

            <h4 style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>

            >
              Just as Allah has commanded the recitation of the Quran with
              Tartil (slow, measured tones), similarly, the Prophet Muhammad
              (peace be upon him) and his companions used to recite the Quran
              with Tajweed, observing the rules of correct pronunciation and
              articulation. It is narrated that he would recite a Surah in a way
              that it would become longer than the Surah itself. (Sahih Muslim:
              733, Nasukh Darussalam: 1712).
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              In addition to this, there are numerous rewards mentioned in the
              Qur'an and book of Sunan about learning and reciting the Qur’an.
              One of these rewards is, one good deed is obtained by reciting one
              letter of Qur’an and reward of every good deed is ten times to
              that of the original one(Sunan Al-Tirmidhi: 01)
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              Do keep in mind that these virtues and rewards can only be
              obtained when the Qur’an is recited with proper pronunciation and
              correct attributions(sahih makharij). The Qur’an must be recited
              in the same manner of Prophet PBUH and His Companions. If not done
              so, they can be entitled to sin rather than rewards.

            <h1>The Ruling of Reading with Tajweed</h1>
            <p

              Imaam Muhammad Ibn Al-Jazari ( may Allah have mercy upon) him who
              was a great Qur'an and Hadeeth scholar of the 9th Hijri century,
              stated in his famous poem that details the rules of Tajweed:
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              "And applying Tajweed is an issue of absolute necessity, Whoever
              doesn't apply Tajweed to the Qur'an, then a sinner is he."
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              Hence, applying the rules of Tajweed is an obligation to keep away
              from the major mistakes in reciting the Qur'an.
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              The scholars have divided the types of mistakes one might fall
              into when reciting the Qur'an into two:
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              1. Clear mistakes: which usually change obvious things and change
              the meaning.
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              2. Hidden mistakes: for which one may need to study Tajweed rules.
            </p>
            <p
              style={{ marginTop: "10px", fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: "1.7" }}
            >
              The majority of scholars agree that applying the Tajweed rules of
              the Qur'an such that the clear mistakes are avoided is an
              individual obligation (Fardh 'Ayn) upon every Muslim who has
              memorised part or all of the Qur'an, while applying the rules of
              Tajweed to avoid the hidden mistakes is a collective obligation
              (Fardh Kifaayah) upon Muslims. That is, there must be some
              students of knowledge who have knowledge of that. This is because
              the Qur'an was revealed with the Tajweed rules applied to it, and
              the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam ( may Allah exalt his
              mention ) recited it back to Jibreel in that way and the
              companions of the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam ( may Allah
              exalt his mention ) read it in that way, so it is an established
              Sunnah (Prophetic tradition or practice).
