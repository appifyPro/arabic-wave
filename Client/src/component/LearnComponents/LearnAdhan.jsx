            <h1>What is Adhan?</h1>
            <p>
              Lexically, adhan means to declare, to announce, to inform. As a
              religious term, adhan means holy words uttered in order to inform
              Muslims about the times of prayers. A person who calls adhan is
              called a muezzin.
            </p>
            <h1>The Importance and Virtues of Adhan:</h1>
            <p>
              Muslims are informed about the times for prayers through adhan;
              they are also reminded that prayer leads man to salvation; thus,
              they are encouraged to perform prayers. More importantly, the
              holiest principles of the religion of Islam like oneness and
              prophethood are declared to the whole world through adhan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, to call adhan gives man a lot of virtues and thawabs.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the hadiths regarding the issue are as follows:</p>
            <p>
              Narrated Abu Huraira(رضي الله عنه): Muhammad (صلي الله عليه وسلم)
              said, If the people knew the reward for pronouncing the Adhan and
              for standing in the first row (in congregational prayers) and
              found no other way to get that except by drawing lots they would
              draw lots. (Sahih Bukhari:615)
            </p>
            <p>
              Mu'awiya (رضي الله عنه) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (
              ‌صلی ‌اللہ ‌علیہ ‌وسلم ‌ ) saying The Mu'adhdhins will have the
              longest necks on the Day of Resurrection. (Sahih Muslim:852)
            </p>
            <p>
              Narrated `Abdur-Rahman: Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri(رضي الله عنه) told my
              father, I see you liking sheep and the wilderness. So whenever you
              are with your sheep or in the wilderness and you want to pronounce
              Adhan for the prayer raise your voice in doing so, for whoever
              hears the Adhan, whether a human being, a jinn or any other
              creature, will be a witness for you on the Day of Resurrection.
              Abu Sa`id added, I heard it (this narration) from Allah's Apostle.
              (Sahih Bukhari:609)
            </p>
            <p>
              Adhan is called like that at the times of noon, afternoon, evening
              and night. For the morning prayer, "as-salatu khayrun mina'n-nawm
              (prayer is better than sleep)" is uttered twice after "hayya
              ala'l-falah". Sleep brings comfort in the world and prayer brings
              comfort in the hereafter; the phrase above is uttered in adhan
              because the comfort in the hereafter is better than the comfort in
              the world. It is disputable whether this phrase needs to be added
              for the adhan of a missed morning prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
              When adhan ends, the following dua needs to be read: Narrated
              Jabir bin `Abdullah: Allah's Apostle said, Whoever after listening
              to the Adhan says, اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَةِ التَّامَّةِ
              وَالصَّلَاةِ الْقَائِمَةِ آتِ مُحَمَّدًا الْوَسِيلَةَ
              وَالْفَضِيلَةَ وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَامًا مَحْمُودًا الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ
              'Allahumma Rabba hadhihi-dda` watit-tammah, was-salatil qa'imah,
              ati Muhammadan al-wasilata wal-fadilah, wa b`ath-hu maqaman
              mahmudan-il-ladhi wa`adtahu' Meaning: [O Allah! Lord of this
              perfect call (perfect by not ascribing partners to You) and of the
              regular prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the
              right of intercession and illustriousness, and resurrect him to
              the best and the highest place in Paradise that You promised him
              (of)], then my intercession for him will be allowed on the Day of
              Resurrection . (Sahih Bukhari:614)
            </p>
